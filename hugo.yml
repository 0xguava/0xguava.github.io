      👋 Hi, Welcome to this page. 

      - I am **Aditya Dhengre**, a Linux user and FOSS enthusiast. 

      - I prefer striking on keyboard, than sliding fingers through laptop's (smooth) touchpad. Anyways, entering commands in terminal suits me than navigating through fancy GUI.

      - I am mostly self taught and I learned about **Linux** and **FOSS** from blogs and documentation. There are other ways for learning, but I prefer reading than just sitting and watching someone talk. 

      - Currently, [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) is my daily driver previously **I was using [Arch](https://archlinux.org) btw!**.  

      - If looking forward to know more then, [About](about/) section is the best place.
