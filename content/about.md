### Introduction

Aditya Vilas Dhengre is an undergraduate at [Shri Sant Gajanan Maharaj College of Engineering - Shegaon](https://ssgmce.ac.in/),
pursuing Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering. 

Aditya has keen interest in learning and developing new skills from scratch.
His tech journey started three years ago when he switched to **GNU/Linux**. Since then, Aditya has been learning about Linux and GNU software and improving every day.

As he is completely **self-taught**, he considers **reading** and **trying things out** as the best way of learning. He has learned about GNU/Linux
by reading documentations, blog posts, forums and seeking community help.

His domain specialization is **System and Network Adminstration**. The choice he made three years ago
makes him fit perfectly in this domain.
